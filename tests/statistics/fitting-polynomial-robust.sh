# Preliminaries
# =============
#
# Set the variables (The executable is in the build tree). Do the
# basic checks to see if the executable is made or if the defaults
# file exists (basicchecks.sh is in the source tree).
prog=statistics
execname=../bin/$prog/ast$prog
table=$topsrc/tests/statistics/fitting-data.txt





# Skip?
# =====
#
# If the dependencies of the test don't exist, then skip it. There are two
# types of dependencies:
#
#   - The executable was not made (for example due to a configure option),
#
#   - The input data was not made (for example the test that created the
#     data file failed).
if [ ! -f $execname ]; then echo "$execname not created."; exit 77; fi
if [ ! -f $table    ]; then echo "$table does not exist."; exit 77; fi





# Actual test script
# ==================
#
# 'check_with_program' can be something like Valgrind or an empty
# string. Such programs will execute the command if present and help in
# debugging when the developer doesn't have access to the user's system.
